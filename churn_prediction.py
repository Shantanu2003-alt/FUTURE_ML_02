Customer Churn Prediction System
A comprehensive machine learning project that predicts which customers are likely to stop using a service. This system helps businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive retention measures.

Overview:
Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses as retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project implements multiple machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn with high accuracy and provides actionable insights for business decision-makers.

Key Objectives:
Predict customer churn probability with high accuracy
Identify key factors driving customer churn
Provide business insights through comprehensive visualizations
Enable proactive customer retention strategies

Features:
Multiple ML Models: Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
Advanced Data Processing: Handles imbalanced datasets using SMOTE
Feature Engineering: Creates meaningful features like senior citizen flag and credit-balance ratio
Comprehensive Evaluation: ROC-AUC, confusion matrices, and classification reports
Feature Importance Analysis: Identifies key churn drivers
Risk Segmentation: Ranks customers by churn probability
Automated Visualizations: Generates publication-ready charts and graphs

Dataset:
The project uses the Bank Customer Churn Dataset from Kaggle which includes:
10,000 customers with 14 features
Customer demographics: Age, Gender, Geography
Account information: Credit Score, Balance, Products Number
Service usage: Tenure, Activity status
Target variable: Exited (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained)

Key Features:
CreditScore: Customer's credit score
Geography: Customer's location (France, Germany, Spain)
Gender: Customer's gender
Age: Customer's age
Tenure: Number of years as customer
Balance: Account balance
NumOfProducts: Number of products used
HasCrCard: Has credit card (1/0)
IsActiveMember: Active membership status (1/0)
EstimatedSalary: Customer's estimated salary
Exited: Target variable (1 = Churned, 0 = Retained)

Results:

Model Performance Summary:
XGBoost: Accuracy = 82.95%, ROC-AUC = 85.14%
Random Forest: Accuracy = 82.80%, ROC-AUC = 85.99%
Logistic Regression: Accuracy = 70.15%, ROC-AUC = 76.83%

Top Churn Drivers (Feature Importance):
Age - Older customers more likely to churn
Number of Products - Customers with fewer products at risk
Geography - Location-based churn patterns
Balance - Account balance correlation with churn
Credit Score - Financial health indicator

Business Insights:
High-Risk Segment: Customers aged 50+ with single product
Geographic Patterns: Germany shows highest churn rates
Balance Impact: Customers with very high or very low balances are at risk
Activity Correlation: Inactive members have 2x higher churn probability
